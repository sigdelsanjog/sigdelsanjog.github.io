# Hyde

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

# Lanyon

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.

### Sticky sidebar content

By default Hyde ships with a sidebar that affixes it's content to the bottom of the sidebar. You can optionally disable this by removing the `.sidebar-sticky` class from the sidebar's `.container`. Sidebar content will then normally flow from top to bottom.

```html
<!-- Default sidebar -->
<div class="sidebar">
  <div class="container sidebar-sticky">
    ...
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Modified sidebar -->
<div class="sidebar">
  <div class="container">
    ...
  </div>
</div>
```


### Themes

Hyde ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add anyone of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

## Development

Hyde has two branches, but only one is used for active development.

- `master` for development.  **All pull requests should be submitted against `master`.**
=======
### Sidebar overlay instead of push

Make the sidebar overlap the viewport content with a single class:

```html
<body class="sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

This will keep the content stationary and slide in the sidebar over the side content. It also adds a `box-shadow` based outline to the toggle for contrast against backgrounds, as well as a `box-shadow` on the sidebar for depth.

It's also available for a reversed layout when you add both classes:

```html
<body class="layout-reverse sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

### Sidebar open on page load

Show an open sidebar on page load by modifying the `<input>` tag within the `sidebar.html` layout to add the `checked` boolean attribute:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" checked>
```

Using Liquid you can also conditionally show the sidebar open on a per-page basis. For example, here's how you could have it open on the homepage only:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" {% if page.title =="Home" %}checked{% endif %}>
```
