title: MOCK ARCHITECTURE DESIGN, MEDICAL DATA INSIGHT
---

Trust Me! Contributors who started this project aren’t any experienced Geeks with years of Developing Experience. Neither we are a Solution Architect who has everything in my mind and could draw everything in a second.  We’re just some technology Enthusiasts who want to contribute to the community and see if it could make any difference. There is a blog post [Open Source Project "MEDICAL DATA INSIGHT". Open Call for Technical/Non Technical Collaboration](http://www.techjhola.com/2017/09/call-for-contributing-in-open-source-project.html) about the Project about how it was started. Right now  we are able to come up with a high level Design of the Application which focuses only on the Technology and its interaction within the Project.
