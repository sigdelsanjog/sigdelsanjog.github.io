title: Earthquake Jolt Experienced at Kathmandu
---

Yesterday night I was working late on preparing the MDI Iteration Retrospective document. I wraped up my task at around 1:50AM and went to bed. But after a few minutes around 02:01AM, I felt this moderate Jolt of Eartrhquake which feared my ass off. I moved to the corridor instantly but the jolt was now gone. Nobody knew that there was an earthquake. I checked twitter and a few of my friends tweeted about the Jolt.

I was still in fear if the shock will be experienced immediately and couldn't sleep. I remember being awake till 3:30AM in the morning. FUCK :(
