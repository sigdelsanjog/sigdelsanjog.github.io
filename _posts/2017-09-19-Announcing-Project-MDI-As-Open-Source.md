title: Announcing Project Medical Data Insight as Open Source

# Nepal Medical Data Visualization( NMDV)

Back in 2015 me with my teammates Shradha, Rizu and Bishwas decided to do a project which will focus on Health Sector of Nepal. This was the last semester project that we would be doing back then. So we named our project as "Nepal Medical Data Visualization". Project was supervised by Dr. Rabindra Bista. Project was developed usign PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, HTML and CSS. I committed the code on github and didn't even look back for a long time.

Last year, I joined Verscend Technologies via Internship program. Verscend  is a company that works on Health Care Information/Data of the United States. My semester project was a key which get me through the internship Program. All credit goes to Rabindra Sir. While working on a Healthcare Informatics Company I always wanted to rewrite my Project and make it meaningful. I wanted to make it open source and wanted to see it implemented in the community someday in future. This is when Medical Data Insight happened.
